## About Me
I am a fourth year pure math major at UCSD. I am broadly interested in differential geometry and low-dimensional topology. I am particularly interested in using algebraic techniques to solve geometric problems.

- *A Little Life* by Hanyah Yanagihara 
- *On Earth we are Briefly Gorgeous* by Ocean Vuong 
- *Hamlet* by William Shakespeare
